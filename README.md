# An implementation of "Online Codes", a type of Fountain Code

This is just a placeholder package at the moment. It is intended to
become a port/rework of my existing Perl/C implementations.

The existing Perl implementation is available as
[Net::OnlineCode](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::OnlineCode) on
CPAN. The source is available [on
github](https://github.com/declanmalone/gnetraid) under the
`Net-OnlineCode` directory.

I note that there is another similarly-named package here on
`crates.io` which implements the same algorithm. If you came here
expecting to find that, you can find it
[here](https://crates.io/crates/online_codes).
